# LivingHeritage--ARscenes-
Project created to user test the creation of an Augmented Reality experience based in oral traditions through the  World Cultural Heritage Site in Arequipa- Peru.

# Project-Concept
Living Heritage is a Augmented Reality exploratory experience in the shape of a Mobile App, that allows the user to explore the city while navigating in different protected spaces finding oral tradition stories from the city of Arequipa, based in four main categories : Historical Characters, Historical Events, Myths and Legends and Memories of the city. This Mobile App will feature the exploration and visualization of different stories provided by the Living Heritage App and also will allow the user to unlock more stories while leveling up collecting historical artifacts related to the stories or landmarks in the exploration. In addition the user will be able to share their own stories recorded by voice, using images and videos. Living Heritage, in a strategy to partner with the community will transform the virtual rewards into real rewards that will provide customized souvenirs and discounts on local stores, for the users of the experience, to promote local tourism and commerce.
